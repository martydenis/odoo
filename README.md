Hi dear web designer,

Welcome to my Odoo Design Exercise, and thank you for this opportunity.
I used the bundler Vite to quickly compile all the assets, as well as the static HTML page in the /dist folder.

Here are the steps to follow in order to display the page :
1. Clone the project from my Github. The project should already be built and ready to preview.
2. I modified the built-up index.html in the /dist folder and removed 'type="module"' from the JS script tag as it was blocked by CORS policy. You should therefore be able to open the html file directly in your browser without needing a private server.
3. If it doesn't work, open a terminal and type 'npm run build', then 'npm run preview'. This should build the project, launch a private server and use the optimized assets. You need to have node JS previously installed.

I also took a few notes that could be useful to you when reviewing the test :
- I couldn't find the precise font you used in the mock-up, but this one is pretty close.
- I reversed the order of the two buttons in the FAQ section compared to that of the mock-up in order to be more consistent accross the whole page. The purchase button is on the right, as it is in the footer.
- I used Chat GPT to write the answers to the FAQ questions.
- Maybe the exercise could be slightly shorter. I think that testing the abilities of designers doesn't require a whole page like this mock-up to be truly efficient. However, it does test our enthusiasm for the position quite well.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Martin
