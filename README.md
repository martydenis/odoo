Hi dear web designer,

Welcome to my Odoo Design Exercise, and thank you for this opportunity.
I used the bundler Vite to quickly compile all the assets and the HTML in the /dist folder.

My design exercise is available at this address: https://martindenis.be/projects/odoo/

Here are the steps to follow in order to display the page :
1. Clone the project from my Github. The project should already be built and ready to preview.
2. Open a terminal and type 'npm run preview'. This will launch a private server and use the optimized assets. You need to have node JS previously installed.

I also took a few notes that could be useful to you when reviewing the test :
- I couldn't find the precise font you used in the mock-up, but this one is pretty close.
- I reversed the order of the two buttons in the FAQ section compared to that of the mock-up in order to be more consistent accross the whole page. The purchase button is on the right, as it is in the footer.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Martin
