Hi dear web designer,

Welcome to my Odoo Design Exercise, and thank you for this opportunity.
I used the bundler Vite to quickly compile all the assets and the HTML in the /dist folder.

My design exercise is available at this address: https://martindenis.be/projects/odoo/

Here are the steps to follow in order to display the page on your environment :
1. Have node JS previously installed.
2. Clone the project from my Github. The project should already be built and ready to preview.
3. Open a terminal and type 'npm run preview'. This will launch a private server and use the optimized assets.

I also took a few notes that could be useful to you when reviewing the exercise :
- I couldn't find the precise font you used in the mock-up, but this one is pretty close.
- I reversed the order of the two buttons in the FAQ section compared to that of the mock-up in order to be more consistent accross the whole page. The purchase button is on the right, as it is in the footer.
- For the awards section, I would imagine creating a slider to display the overflowing cards (like the paypal one) on smaller resolutions.
- I resized some images to display them at their actual viewing size and optimize their weight.
- When clicking on the odoo logos and links on my website (with a href="/"), they direct to the homepage of my own website. I chose to leave them as they are because that is how I would write them in a real environment.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Martin
